# Angular Express Seed

 Use the sample json datasets (or upload your own if you like) in the public/data folder to build a simple app.
  
## requirements:
  - A Single Page App that loads a dataset and allows the addition and deletion of items in the dataset.
  - The app must make a minimum of two calls to the backend API - one to delete the item and one to add an item.
  - The page should also show overall data (number of entries, etc) about the dataset to the user.
  - This data must be two way bound so changes are reflected immediately.
  - It must be built using raw HTML - no Jade/Handlebars/etc.
  - The page must be properly styled with custom CSS - use the public/css folder for css files. (feel free to use a css framework - Material Design/Bootstrap/etc)
  - You must add at least one package from NPM for the node server and one package for the angular.js
  - At least one other feature of your choosing must be added. 
  
  Fork the project and push changes back to the master when finished. 

### Running the app

Runs like a typical express app:

    node app.js
    
    head to http;//localhost:3000 in your browser
